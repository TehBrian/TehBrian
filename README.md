### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Brian, and I enjoy creating cool things, whether that be music, software, or artwork. I'm always trying to learn new skills and improve as a person so that maybe one day I can be the best version of myself!

Most of my projects are plugins for Minecraft written in Java, but I'm constantly learning different technologies. My main passion project is [The Floating City](https://thefloating.city), which I've been working on for quite some time, and has followed me through my growth as a developer.

If you've got an idea for some software or need help with anything, don't hesitate to contact me! I strive to be friendly and kind, and my Discord DMs are always open. My Discord tag is TehBrian#6219. I'll even do some software development work for free if my schedule allows! 

Here are some other places that you can find me:
- [Website](https://tehbrian.xyz) (if you want even more info on me, maybe check here first..)
- [Discord Server](https://tehbrian.xyz/discord)
- [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/members/tehbrian.335560/)
- [Patreon](https://patreon.com/tehbrian) .. hand me your money :)
