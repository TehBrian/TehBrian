### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Brian, and I enjoy creating cool things, whether that be music, software, or artwork.

Most of my projects are plugins for Minecraft, written in Java, but I'm constantly trying to learn different technologies. My main passion project is [The Floating City](https://thefloating.city), which I've been working on for quite some time, and has followed me through my growth as a developer.

If you've got an idea for some software or need help with anything, don't hesitate to contact me! I strive to be friendly and kind, and my Discord DMs are always open. My Discord tag is TehBrian#6219, but I'd prefer if you joined [my server](https://chat.tehbrian.xyz) and we talked there. 

Here are some other places that you can find me:
- [Website](https://tehbrian.xyz) (if you want even more info on me, maybe check here first..)
- [Discord Server](https://chat.tehbrian.xyz)
- [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/members/tehbrian.335560/)
- [Patreon](https://patreon.com/tehbrian) .. hand me your money :)

Also, here's a picture of a cat.
